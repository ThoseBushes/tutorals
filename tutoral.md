# Welcome to the wonderful world of programming!

To get started, open up your terminal. This can be done either with Spotlight or by clicking on its icon. When you open it, you should see something like this: ![Terminal](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2021/06/macos-terminal-basics.png)\
This is the shell, it's is a derect way to tell your computer what to do. Let's get familiar with it since you're gonna be using it a lot. Firstly, let's just break down this image line by line. We'll start at the top with ```Last Login Fri Jun 4 14:15:10 on ttys000```. What does all this mean? Well when you open up the terminal, you create a new session. The bulk of this information is self explanitory, just information on when the last session was, but what about that last bit ```on ttys000```, what does that mean? Well, we'll need some history, you see back before computers could fit in your pocket, they took up large rooms. You could do all your work in that room, however, not only would it be loud, and likely warm, it would be impracticle, on top of that, what if you needed had 30 people that needed to use a computer, how would you that work? It wouldn't. In order to actually have computers be useful, one would need to have the employees and the computer in different places, but how would that work when the employees still need a way to comunicate with the computer? Luckly, there was already a device that would work for such a task called the teletype. That's what the ```tty``` in ```ttys000``` stands for. The ```s``` stands for simulated, and the ```000``` means it's the first. Now onto the next line, the ```torankin ~ %```. ```torankin``` what's that? It's the hostname, basicly, it's the name of the computer. How 'bout ```~```? That's the current directory. And the ```%```? that's the user indicator. ```%``` or ```$``` means you're your normal user, and ```#``` means your a special user called ```root```. Why root? I don't know, look it up on your own time. 

Now that we got that out of the way, let's learn a few basic commands. Type ```echo "Hello world!"``` and press enter. It should've written ```Hello world!``` on the next line. Well, that doesn't seem all that useful now does it? You're right, so let's do something else, type ```echo "Hello world!" > hello```, and hit enter. It didn't print this time? Well it did, but you didn't see it. Why? Type ```cat hello``` and press enter to find out. You see how doing that printed ```Hello world!``` to the next line? that's because when we added the ```> hello``` to the end of ```echo "Hello world!```, we told the shell to take the output, and put it into a file called ```hello```. Now I'm guessing you don't want a random file on your computer, so let's get rid of it. To do so, type ```rm hello``` and hit enter. ```rm``` removes a file. Now a bit of a warning, files removed with ```rm``` aren't added to the trashcan or whatever nor is there any conformaton most of the time, so be careful and deliberate when using ```rm```. From now on we'll be doing everything in a different folder as to not clutter up your home. Home? What do I mean home? I mean your home directory. Each real user has a home directory. To see yours, type ```echo $HOME```, and press enter. It should've printed ```/home/(your username)```. Remember when we were talking about what the text on the terminal says, and I said ```~``` is the current directory, well type ```echo ~```, and hit enter. That's right, ```~``` and ```$HOME``` are the same thing. Why? Cause it's faster to type ```~``` than it is to type ```$HOME```. Now why do I keep typing ```$HOME```, like what is that? It's called an envirenment varable, and it's how prograsms know things about your system. I don't know many, and we won't be covering those in this document, so don't worry about them. If wou would like to know more about them, go to [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variables). Why the Arch Linux wiki when I'm on Mac? Because, even though Macos, and Arch Linux are different, They're both UNIX-like, and thus share a lot of commonalities. Note that most things on the Arch Linux wiki won't apply on Macos. Okay, where were we? Right, we were going to take this into a new folder. To do that, let's make one. I like to keep all my projects in seperate folders in my projects folder. Let's do the same for you. Type ```mkdir -p projects/tutoral``` and hit enter. Let's break down this command. ```mkdir``` is the command to make a directory. ```-p```, what is that? Most commands have what are called switches. They modify how the command runs. For ```mkdir```, the ```-p```, or ```--parents``` switch makes parent directories "as needed." Why did I say "```-p```, or ```--parents```?" Most commands have two sets of switches, long form, and short form. These aren't technical terms by any means, and if you want to see what switches a program has, you can use ```(command) -h```, and if that dosen't work, ```(command) --help```, and if that dosen't work, curse the bloodline of the programmer who made that tool. Why don't you try it out? The command ```cd``` is used for changing the current directory, try to use it to get to the directory we just made.

If you couldn't figure it out, don't worry. To get there, do ```cd projects/tutoral```. Cool, now where in a fresh, empty folder. It's empty right? Do me a favor and check with ```ls -a```. What's this? Why does it say there's a ```.```, and a ```..```, what are those? If you didn't catch it when you did the ```cd --help```, ```.``` is the current directory, and ```..```, is the parent directory. Hmm, it seems I got ahead of myself. Do me a favor and type ```touch file```. Now do the ```ls -a``` again. You should notice that ```.```, and ```..```, are one color, and ```file``` is another. That's because the program ```ls```, colors filess based on their type, in my case, blue for directories, and white for normal files. 

So, there are more commands that you should know:

- ls: lists the contents of a directory if none is given, list the contents of the current directory.
- cd: change to the specified directory
- mkdir: make a directory
- chmod: change the permissions of a file
- rm: remove a file
- clear: clears the terminal
- man: opens up the manual page for a command. ```man (command)```
- touch: creates an empty file.

That's it, that's all I feel like writing in this tutoral on the terminal.
